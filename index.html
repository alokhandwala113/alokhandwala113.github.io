  <h1>A function for generating prime numbers as per sequence</h1>
<p><strong><em>May 30th, 2019</em> by Aziz Lokhandwala</strong></p>
<h2>Abstract: From the modular expressions for approximating Ï€ given by S.Ramanujan, I found my own function which can give prime numbers as per sequence but not as per xth order, so please don't mix up this with my one of the theory of "Making an approximations for nth index using Prime number Theorem".</h2>

<p>The function can be given as:
    $$f(x) = {e^{{x^{1\over 2}}}} + 1 + {|ln|(ln...xtimes)|}$$<em>'x' belongs to N U {0}</em></p>

<p>If anyone can find a proof for this, he/she will be awarded with a great prize amount.</p>
